# REFLECTION/AREAS OF GROWTH 

Initial, when protyping scriptWARS the game had a lot more functionality, however when starting I was forced to focus on creating an minimum viable product, which means:
1. The game had to have starting instructions, and a start button feature 
2. Upon clicking the start button, the Game was to load
3. The game mechanics should work, which is assigning a score for the correct answers
4. The game was to have winning condition 
5. The game was to have a restart button 

In the next version of the game I would like to be able to improve on the following functions as initially planned:
1. Wrong answers function to be improved allow the oppourtunity for the other player to answer the question and earn points 
2. Timer to be introduced 
3. Tracker for overall games won 
4. An external database with all the questions
